<p>My partner and I were both long time vegans. When someone who was interested in going vegan asked us for help, we didn't have much for online resources to give them.</p>
<p>The closest thing to a true online Vegan Kit were small, poorly designed embedded pages in Animal Organization websites with plenty of links guilt-tripping users into shelling out money to the organization to save animals (but rarely to go vegan).</p>

<p>We designed VeganKit to be an all-in-one resource for those already vegan or wishing to become so. We didn't want to shove gory imagery in people's faces, accepted no money--not even from advertisements, and didn't even put our names on it. We wanted our users to focus on veganism and the animals who benefit from it.</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>To build VeganKit, I used Kickstrap 1, which was unreleased at the time. As with most of my implementations of Bootstrap, I prefer to use elements like navigation and scaffolding, but leave the rest of the design to custom CSS. In this case, we wanted to have a measured set of columns take on a certain color and bleed out to the top, left, and bottom, while the rest of the page remained white. It's harder than it sounds without using CSS's new flexbox.</p>
<p>After numerous users suggested we offer the site in multiple languages and many had offered to translate for us, we organized a group of volunteer translators, upgraded to Django, and currently have the site available in Swedish, Spanish, Romanian, German, and many other languages coming soon.</p>
