<p>TinyGrowl is a very small ( ~0.7kb minified) js file for creating simple growl messages in Bootstrap.</p><p>The need to create this came from replacing an older third-party library used in Kickstrap 1. It worked well but was very large and unmaintained. </p><p>I found that by simply reusing as much code from Bootstrap's alerts as possbile, I just need to make a few minor adjustments inside a jQuery library and the alerts ended up working very well. They're now included in Kickstrap 2.</p><p> <a onclick="$.growl({title: 'It worked!',text: 'Yippee',delay: 1500, type: 'success'})" class="pointer">Try it</a></p>
