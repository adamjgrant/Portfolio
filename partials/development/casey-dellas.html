<p>Fitness trainer and nutrional counselor Casey Dellas wanted to upgrade the experience of his website, pictured below:</p><p><div class="row"><div class="col col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><div class="thumbnail"><img src="/img/cd_oldsite.png" class="img-responsive"/><div class="caption">Dellas's old site was plagued with poor design and navigation.</div></div></div></div></p><p>We set out to create a consistent look and feel for the site while making it easy for users to navigate on any device. The result is pictured below.</p><p><img src="/img/cd_desktop1.png" class="img-responsive"/></p><p>Here is a demonstration of the different behavior on a variety of device types:</p><div class="row"><div class="thumbnail"><div class="col col-md-4"><img src="/img/cd_mobile1.png" class="img-responsive"/></div><div class="col col-md-4"><img src="/img/cd_mobile2.png" class="img-responsive"/></div><div class="col col-md-4"><img src="/img/cd_mobile3.png" class="img-responsive"/></div><div class="clearfix"></div><br/><div class="col col-md-4"><img src="/img/cd_tablet1.png" class="img-responsive"/></div><div class="col col-md-4"><img src="/img/cd_tablet2.png" class="img-responsive"/></div><div class="col col-md-4"><img src="/img/cd_tablet3.png" class="img-responsive"/></div><div class="clearfix"></div><br/><div class="col col-md-4"><img src="/img/cd_desktop1.png" class="img-responsive"/></div><div class="col col-md-4"><img src="/img/cd_desktop4.png" class="img-responsive"/></div><div class="col col-md-4"><img src="/img/cd_desktop3.png" class="img-responsive"/></div><div class="clearfix"></div><br/><div class="caption">Using jQuery UI, we were able to create an appearance similar to a native app.</div></div></div><p>I used Kickstrap 1 with jQuery mobile exclusively for mobile devices. Keeping the two sites separate is not noramlly something I do, but we had some stellar design tricks that really worked best on desktop. If taken away on mobile, it would require a lot of re-engineering for it to make sense.</p><h3>User Testing</h3><p>Before setting out too far, I did some user testing with my product,  <a ng-click="setLocation('delights', 'lab95')" class="pointer">Lab95</a>, on the current site to identify user's initial impressions.</p><p><div class="row"><div class="col col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><div class="thumbnail"><img src="/img/cd_graph1.png" class="img-responsive"/><img src="/img/cd_graph2.png" class="img-responsive"/><img src="/img/cd_graph3.png" class="img-responsive"/><div class="caption">I used my own product, <a ng-click="setLocation('delights', 'lab95')" class="pointer">Lab95 </a>to test users' memories to Five Second Tests--showing the website only briefly.</div></div></div></div></p><p>Overall, the numbers weren't the worst I've seen, but there was certainly some confusion about what Casey was offering and whether he was a reputable source of business.</p><p>We agreed on some basic design improvements--Testimonials should be embedded into the content, not separated onto one page. There should only be submenus for content within a page. The home page should have a clear call to action with a secondary action.</p><p>To keep the navigation clear and consistent, I also wrote some custom code for desktop to fix headers above the page and glide content under a soft gradient as the user scrolled.</p><div class="row"><div class="thumbnail"><div class="col col-md-4"><img src="/img/cd_fadeeffect1.png" class="img-responsive"/></div><div class="col col-md-4"><img src="/img/cd_fadeeffect2.png" class="img-responsive"/></div><div class="col col-md-4"><img src="/img/cd_fadeeffect3.png" class="img-responsive"/></div><div class="clearfix"></div><br/><div class="caption">Content appears in a large, readable font and slides under the header of the currently viewed section.</div></div></div><p>In the long run, the numbers turned out in our favor:</p><p><div class="thumbnail"><div class="row"><div class="col col-md-6"><img src="/img/cd_graph1.png" class="img-responsive"/></div><div class="col col-md-6"><img src="/img/cd_graph4.png" class="img-responsive"/></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col col-md-6"><img src="/img/cd_graph2.png" class="img-responsive"/></div><div class="col col-md-6"><img src="/img/cd_graph5.png" class="img-responsive"/></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col col-md-6"><img src="/img/cd_graph3.png" class="img-responsive"/></div><div class="col col-md-6"><img src="/img/cd_graph6.png" class="img-responsive"/></div></div><div class="caption">Huge improvements in results in each of the three tests.</div></div></p>
