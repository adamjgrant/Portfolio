<p>A powerful starter kit with an acclaimed design and 1,000 daily visitors</p>
<p>When my partner and I, both long-time vegans, were asked by our friends for guides on veganism, we were unhappy with the landscape.</p><img src="/img/vk_iphone.png" class="pull-right img-responsive col-md-6"/>
<p>Gory videos, plugs from celebrities incorrectly attributed as vegan, and shameless panhandling for donations were guarantees for readers. To make matters worse, the websites were profoundly ugly.</p>
<blockquote>Wow! Just...wow! I'm a new vegan (a year this month) and wish I had found your site earlier in my journey.... your site is brilliant, beautiful and engaging. I will definitely be passing it along to non-vegans as well as vegans (so they can pass it along). You've really touched on everything and the clean layout and use of simple design and muted colors is perfection.<small>Paulina (a reader)</small></blockquote>
<blockquote>VeganKit.com has to be one of the best, most informative sites on vegansism I've seen. It's easy to navigate and covers all of the essential aspects of vegan life. It's a handy resource if you ever have any friends that have questions about veganism, or you need an answer yourself.<small> <a href="http://vegansofig.tumblr.com/post/31359408174/vegankit-com-has-to-be-one-of-the-best-most">vegansofig</a></small></blockquote>
<blockquote>THIS IS F---ING GREAT! Will plug on the show today!<small><a href="http://wearecitizenradio.com/">Jamie Killstein of Citizen Radio</a></small></blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLELUJAH Check out this absolutely phenomenal website, VeganKit.com. Total genius.<small>Erin Red</small></blockquote>
<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>First and foremost, VeganKit needed to be the starter kit on veganism and nothing else--not a splash page to another site, not a tab on some recipe page, but a standalone and dedicated gem of the life of veganism.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, we started with the user, iterating over personas we created from the many encounters we've had over the years with people interested in going vegan. We user-tested and card sorted with different categories, trying to keep these limited to about 5-6 and came up with the navigation we have today.</p>
<p>The goal was to ensure consistent flow through the pages regardless of the user's unique motivation--environmental concerns, animal ethics, diet, etc. We set out to create highly relevant categories filled with non-academic language, warm and faded colors, high quality custom photos with a DSLR camera, and social proof via YouTube videos and saved tweets.</p>
<p>The site was initially built in static HTML, then rewritten in PHP, and finally rewritten again in Django to employ international translations. Thanks to a swarm of our international friends, this is currently in progress.</p>
