          Adam Grant (born Adam Kochanowicz on October 10, 1986) is a Full Stack Developer and UX Designer 
          living in Menlo Park, California.

          ## Early Life

          Adam's father, Thomas Kochanowicz was a software developer and Certified
          Java Programmer (CJP) from Omaha Nebraska. Before his death in 2013, he
          developed an online classified ads website called BlueAds.com, one year
          before the invention of Craigslist. He also filed three patents for
          woodworking equipment. Adam's mother, Sharon, is a Nurse Practitioner, also 
          in Omaha.

          Adam began tinkering with computers with his family at a very early age. His
          father helped him to build his own computer with parts at a local computer store.
          From his father's work he received copies of otherwise expensive operating systems
          and development software. He experimented with Symantec Visual Page for creating
          HTML websites (see [Edupedia](/delights/edupedia/), [Adeus](/delights/adeus/), and
          [Fake Chat](http://localhost:3000/delights/fake-chat/))

          When he wasn't on the computer, he would take apart his old toys and electronics
          to see how they worked. On at least one occasion, he was able to assemble a working
          radio using only parts from a computer speaker, some magnets, and batteries.

          In sixth grade, he developed an interest in French after reading about France
          in an encyclopedia. He soon discovered a small subset of French-speaking 
          Omahaans thanks to the francophone West African population.

          ## Life in New York

          In 2011, Adam moved to Lauzerte, France where he worked at a luxury spa
          marketed as a Vegan Weight-loss Bootcamp. There, he helped with tasks around the
          spa but mostly fulfilled his main role as a developer on the owners's auction
          website, [Powabunga](/development/powabunga/).

          Three months later, he moved to New York City, living in Harlem, the Upper West Side
          and, finally meeting his wife Sylviane Grant and moving to Union Square.

          In New York, he began working for a startup in New Jersey as a UX Developer/Designer.
          In 2012, he lead User Experience design for Debtdomain.com, a loan syndication
          company, later acquired by Ipreo in 2013. By January of 2014, after closely following
          the work of Eric Reis, Joshua Seiden, and Jeff Gotthelf, he started as a designer
          and front end developer at [Neo](http://neo.com), a company founded and/or 
          operated by all three.

          In 2015, Sylviane and Adam decided to move to the Silicon Valley to be closer to
          family and work. And that's where our story leaves off.
