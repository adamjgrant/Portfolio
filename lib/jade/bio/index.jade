          Adam Grant is a Systems Expert currently working as a Software Engineer and 
          Lead Developer for Apple in Cupertino California. He also works as a Voice Actor
          for [The City Within The Walls](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-city-within-the-walls-podcast/id1446805578) as "Jones" and [has provided voiceover intros](//adamgrantvoice.com) for tons of independent podcasts.

          ## More information than you asked for

          Adam's father, Thomas Kochanowicz was a software developer and Certified
          Java Programmer from Omaha Nebraska. Before his death in 2013, he
          developed an online classified ads website called BlueAds.com, one year
          before the invention of Craigslist. He also filed three patents for
          woodworking equipment. Adam's mother, Sharon, is a Nurse Practitioner, also 
          in Omaha.

          Adam began tinkering with computers with his family at a very early age. His
          father helped him to build his own computer with parts at a local computer store.
          From his father's work he received copies of otherwise expensive operating systems
          and development software. He experimented with Symantec Visual Page for creating
          HTML websites (see [Edupedia](/delights/edupedia/), [Adeus](/delights/adeus/), and
          [Fake Chat](http://localhost:3000/delights/fake-chat/))

          When he wasn't on the computer, he would take apart his old toys and electronics
          to see how they worked. On at least one occasion, he was able to assemble a working
          radio using only parts from a computer speaker, some magnets, and batteries.

          In sixth grade, he developed an interest in French after reading about France
          in an encyclopedia. He soon discovered a small subset of French-speaking 
          Omahaans thanks to the francophone West African population. He found himself
          speaking French on a regular basis with friends, eventually gaining fluency as
          an adult.

          ## France

          In 2011, Adam moved to Lauzerte, France where he worked at a luxury spa
          marketed as a Vegan Weight-loss Bootcamp. There, he helped with tasks around the
          spa but mostly fulfilled his main role as a developer on the owners's auction
          website.

          ## NYC

          Three months later, he moved to New York City, living in Harlem, the Upper West Side
          and, finally meeting his wife Sylviane Grant and moving to Union Square.

          During his time in New York, he developed an extension framework for Bootstrap
          called [Kickstrap](/development/kickstrap/). Becoming frustrated with the 
          landscape of CSS frameworks, he evolved this into [Kickstart](/development/kickstart/), 
          a fully extendible CSS library. Kickstart has been one of Adam's most popular 
          inventions to date. This is about the time he started working with Rails on side projects.

          In New York, he began working for a startup in New Jersey as a UX Developer/Designer.
          In 2012, he lead User Experience design for Debtdomain.com, a loan syndication
          company, later acquired by Ipreo in 2013. By January of 2014, after closely following
          the work of Eric Reis, Joshua Seiden, and Jeff Gotthelf, he started as a designer
          and front end developer at Neo, a company founded and/or 
          operated by all three. There he worked as a Designer and Full Stack Developer, finally
          working on projects as a bonafide Rails engineer.

          In 2015, Sylviane and Adam decided to move to the Silicon Valley to be closer to
          family and work. Shortly after moving, he starting working at Apple where he is now a
          Software Engineer and Lead Developer in Retail Technology.
