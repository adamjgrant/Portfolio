p I noticed that my sites' main css files continuously grew larger as I needed to style more and more elements. However, often these styles are applied to just a few elements rarely appearing in the site or further down the page. By splitting these styles into additional CSS files further down the DOM, the page loads first, only with the styles it really needs.

p To combat the problem of elements "jerking" into place once their styles have loaded, one can use special rules to hide and style content, later resetting these rules in secondary stylesheets.
p For images, I encoded each in Base64 and assigned them to a background-image property of a container. When the page loads, each such container shows a loading spinner until it is replaced by the Base64 CSS loaded later. Because it's a single property, the image only replaces the spinner when it is completely loaded.
