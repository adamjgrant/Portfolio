p A powerful starter kit with an acclaimed design and 1,000 daily visitors

p When my partner and I, both long-time vegans, were asked by our friends for guides on veganism, we were unhappy with the landscape.

p Gory videos, plugs from celebrities incorrectly attributed as vegan, and shameless panhandling for donations were guarantees for readers. To make matters worse, the websites were profoundly ugly.
blockquote Wow! Just...wow! I'm a new vegan (a year this month) and wish I had found your site earlier in my journey.... your site is brilliant, beautiful and engaging. I will definitely be passing it along to non-vegans as well as vegans (so they can pass it along). You've really touched on everything and the clean layout and use of simple design and muted colors is perfection.

blockquote VeganKit.com has to be one of the best, most informative sites on vegansism I've seen. It's easy to navigate and covers all of the essential aspects of vegan life. It's a handy resource if you ever have any friends that have questions about veganism, or you need an answer yourself.

p First and foremost, VeganKit needed to be the starter kit on veganism and nothing else--not a splash page to another site, not a tab on some recipe page, but a standalone and dedicated gem of the life of veganism.

p To accomplish this, we started with the user, iterating over personas we created from the many encounters we've had over the years with people interested in going vegan. We user-tested and card sorted with different categories, trying to keep these limited to about 5-6 and came up with the navigation we have today.
p The goal was to ensure consistent flow through the pages regardless of the user's unique motivation--environmental concerns, animal ethics, diet, etc. We set out to create highly relevant categories filled with non-academic language, warm and faded colors, high quality custom photos with a DSLR camera, and social proof via YouTube videos and saved tweets.
p The site was initially built in static HTML, then rewritten in PHP, and finally rewritten again in Django to employ international translations. Thanks to a swarm of our international friends, this is currently in progress.
