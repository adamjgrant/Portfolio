p I've always been fascinated with the technology behind bitcoin, but frustrated by how user un-friendly it all is.

p I quickly learned the best way to keep my bitcoins was on cold storage--paper wallets. This means your bitcoins are associated with a set of keys that are printed on paper. This kind of storage is "cold" because these keys are not stored electronically, where they could be accessed by hackers.
p This method works very well, but I knew we still needed some solution for everyday spending so bitcoin could be more than a commodity; something that could actually be used at a point of sale.

p By keeping bitcoins stored over many different bills in differing denominations, it limits a theif's ability to steal your coins (In the same way carrying a bunch of 20s is better than a 100 dollar bill.)
p This project remains an open source project for any developers to make their own equipment that uses these designs. So far, Jeff Hockema of
