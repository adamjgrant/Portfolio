    While at Neo, I noticed a lot of our MVPs required us to get information from users in some way. As MVPs, we didn't always have the time to build out database-supported systems or mailing applications.
    
    Some of our products were so (intentionally) simple, they consisted of nothing more than a landing page. Our solution to this was to create a "mailto" link. This is simply a hyperlink that triggers your default mail client to open up. These links can also prepopulate to, from, subject, and body fields.
    
    Unfortunately, lots of users including myself find this very irritating when the default mail application isn't really what you use for email.
