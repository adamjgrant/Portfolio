<p>Every patron to the Comedy Cellar automatically gets a great discount at The Fat Black Pussycat, the owner's neighboring bar. Yet, the number of people who used the discount was underwhelming.</p><p>I believed most of that reason was due to the site's design and overall reservation creation experience. Revamping it was a huge task, so we collaborated on a way to give patrons an interactive set of cards on their phones.</p><p>Because the cards were designed for the phone, touch-sensitive, and readable, users were more likely to carry them around and refer to them over an email.</p><p>By designing one of the cards as the discount coupon, it was easy for patrons to see the coupon, feel they already "owned" it, and be reminded of it at a more appropriate time.</p>
