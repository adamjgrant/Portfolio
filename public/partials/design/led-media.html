<p>LED media was an ambitious company when I found it. The business already had telemarketers, business analysts, and social media experts but relied on one-off contract jobs to build its three concurrently-launching websites.</p>
<p>The three websites were CharityBlooms, ChurchBlooms, and Tee-Links. The later two allowed patrons of churches and charities to register with the church or charity and give a percentage of their purchase from purchases on 1800Flowers.com.</p>
<p>Tee-Links is a discount golfing website where users can find exclusive pricing on golf outings at major clubs in Florida.</p>
<p>Needless to say, being hired as their single technical employee was an overwhelming tasks. I managed to get the company on source control, fixed the front end code, wrote Wordpress and Magento extensions, and vetted further contract work.</p>
<p>Eventually, we were able to hire another programmer and I shifted more of my focus to UX so I could work between the business and development side.</p>
