<p>UX Zen was a project of passion. I wanted to keep my Twitter feed active and share the things I found that made me feel good about being a UX Designer.</p>
<p>I wanted this to be more than just a automatic link-sharer. I waited a long time before starting the project, collecting 365 quotations and links that really spoke to me.</p>

  <div class="caption">The home screen shows a borderless immersion of great design and ideas. The sidebar populates with a random selection of "zens" from those that are published.</div>
</p>
<p>At the same time, I had been collecting my favorite of the favorite visual designs into a folder so I could browse over them now and then for inspiration.</p>
<p>Once I reached 365 "zens," I started the design by pulling from the photoset and automatically scheduling the posts to publish daily and tweet to my Twitter account.</p>

<p>Once I hit 365, I'm not sure if I'll create another 365 or curate the previous list for the best of the best and fill in the gaps.</p>
