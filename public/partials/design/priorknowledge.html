<h3>Site Rebranding</h3>
<p>PK was running their operations on a website built with three very different frameworks. I not only rebranded the product, but deployed the styles site-wide.</p>
<p>PriorKnowledge approached me for a quick job. They had three parts to their website, a blog, home page, and docs page. None of the three looked like each other, so they wanted me to redesign each to provide a consistent appearance. This was a little tricky, not just as a design task, but a technical task as well. The blog was written in Jekyll, the Docs in Wordpress, and the homepage in static HTML with Twitter Bootstrap. None of the HTML was consistent and the new CSS files would need to pretend the contrary.</p>
