<p>As my web skills sharpened, I wanted to try them out making some simple one-off applications just to see how they'd fare to the public. As I pondered what sort of application the public would find enjoyable, I remembered how much fun it was to use Post-It notes; drawing on them, writing notes, sticking them together to create artwork. </p><p>I thought it would be neat to create a kind of virtual wall for people to do just that.</p><p>As a twist, users need not only write in the colored squares, they could also type in "shortcodes" which automatically generate images. For example, "img:jackiechan" shows a popular image of him raising his hands over his head in disbelief. I also had it programmed to recognize youtube links and automatically embed.</p><p>Unfortunately, shortly after finishing the product, my computer was stolen out of my car along with my iPad. I lost most of the code save for some of it I had backed up a week before.</p>
