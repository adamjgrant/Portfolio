<p>I love the command line. Once you get used to it, you'll find it's a far more efficient way to work than through a GUI. I wanted to provide a monolithic, extendible command line for the web. This would take the standard UNIX syntax and convert it into structured JavaScript properties to be processed by a function.</p><p>For example, the command <code>createalert 'Welcome' -d --small</code> contains a command, argument, option, and property. It would be processed by this function:</p><p> <pre>kbash.createalert = function(args, opts, props) { ... }</pre></p><p>From then on, it's just plain JavaScript coding.</p><p>For the display of the terminal itself, I relied heavily on CSS3 to create a realistic blinking cursor, and JavaScript to bind keys. </p><p>The terminal also supports history in the same way as a UNIX terminal--the arrow up key.</p><p>While I haven't pursued the project much further, I can see it being useful for JavaScript testing.</p>
