<p>I was hired at Creative Works in Omaha, Nebraska as a UI/UX designer, though my role was very broad.</p>
<p>Creative Works which is no longer in business, was a company that took on many small clients at once and distributed the work to a team of diversely-talented individuals.</p>
<p>Some of the work required collaboration between designers, sysadmins, Wordpress experts, and front-end developers all at once. Any one of us, however, would usually fulfill more than one of these roles at a time and learn new skills when necessary.</p>
<p>Our clients included small storefronts needing an e-commerce solution, microsites for brands doing seasonal promotions, and projects of passion from individuals.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite projects to work on at the time were Wordpress websites. PHP isn't my favorite language by any means, but I really enjoyed creating components that users could easily install with the click of a button. Unfortunately, per contract, I wasn't able to actually distribute any of these into the public plugin repository.</p>
<p>My time at CW was a whirlwind of constant learning. Every week I was working on a project I was completely unprepared for the week before. Yet somehow we managed to get everything done on time.</p>
