p Sit down and have enough beers with me and I'll tell you all my evil plans to redo email as we know of it. 

p Email meta is the only non-code projects I have on this page only because it ultimately requires implementation in code. 

p This is instead a working document to establish a protocol email systems can use to identify their emails as one of a type. 

p In other words, not all emails are messages.  Emails today come in the form of account confirmations, notifications, newsletters, and even storage. Email meta suggests that emails can simply add a few meta tags to their HTML to indentify their type. By doing so, email get more attention from the sendees and are better sorted for users.
