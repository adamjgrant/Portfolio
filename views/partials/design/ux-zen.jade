p UX Zen was a project of passion. I wanted to keep my Twitter feed active and share the things I found that made me feel good about being a UX Designer.

p Once I reached 365 "zens," I started the design by pulling from the photoset and automatically scheduling the posts to publish daily and tweet to my Twitter account.
